Alex, 
I am especially anxious and excited to see what you will do after graduation, the reason is that I think you have so much potential to contribute new and interesting knowledge to some field (math or CS). As a faculty member, you never want to push any student into some endeavour that you think is good for them, but which they may not necessarily want. However, in your case, I've been really really hoping that you'll choose academia and research (towards which you seem to be leaning anyways). No doubt, you can get a really cool job at a place like Google with a BS or an advanced degree, but I can't help but feel that you'll learn so much more and have so much more to give back in an academic research setting. But, again, this is just my OPINION, you must do what feels right to you.
Anyways, I'll tell you the same thing as I told my advisees: you have an open invitation to keep in touch with me just as you would if I were still living in my office down the hall. If I can help you forward your goals in any way, I'd be happy to do so.
