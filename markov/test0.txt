Hi Alex,
I just thought of something disturbing about your model for Project 10. While I don't know what exactly are the states and transitions in your Markov chain, the way we'd been talking about it (with state vectors representing the distribution of genotypes across the initial population), it does not seem reasonable that the system is regular. For if it were, then we know that there is a unique equilib v and than all initial distributions will approach v. But if the initial population has zero amount of people who are color blind then it doesn't make sense for the genotype distr to approach anything other than the initial distr. I think there is something I don't understand about the way you set up your model - please bring it in for me to look at before making a final submission.
